# PDP Test ‚Äì Diego I√±iguez

This project is my submission for the Frontend Developer Technical Test. It replicates a **Product Detail Page (PDP)** inspired by the [Loverboy product example]([https://drinkloverboy.com/products/](https://drinkloverboy.com/products/cosmopolitan) using **Dawn Shopify theme** to save time and focus on custom implementation.
You can visit the PDP directly in:

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

**Optimization Recommendation:**  
To improve load performance on mobile, I optimized image delivery using Shopify's built-in `image_url` filter with explicit width parameters.  
Example:

```liquid
{{ product.featured_image | image_url: width: 385 | image_tag }}
